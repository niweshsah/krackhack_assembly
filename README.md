## Setup and Installation üöÄ

### Prerequisites
- React.js, Node.js and npm installed.
- Aptos CLI installed.
- Petra Wallet.

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/niweshsah/krackhack_assembly.git
   cd krackhack_assembly/
   ```
2. Install Dependencies
    ```bash
    cd frontend/
    npm install
    cd ..
    cd backend/
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```
3. Set Up Aptos CLI:
    
  - Install the Aptos CLI:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://aptos.dev/scripts/install_cli.py | python3
    ```

    cd backend/
    node server.js
    ```
    
5. Access the Application:

    Open http://localhost:3000 or other in your browser.

## NFT Smart Contract Implementation
The NFT smart contract is implemented in TypeScript using the Aptos SDK. The main contract logic is located in nft_code/src/main_nft.ts, which handles NFT creation and interactions.

### Running the Contract
To execute the contract, follow these steps:

   - Navigate to the nft_code directory:
      ```bash
      cd nft_code
      ```
   - Compile the TypeScript code:
      ```bash
      npx tsc
      ```
   - Run the generated JavaScript file:
      ```bash
      node dist/main_nft.js
      ```
   - Sample Execution Output
      ```bash
      friday_code@JARVIS:~/Music/krackhack_assembly/nft_code$ npx tsc
      friday_code@JARVIS:~/Music/krackhack_assembly/nft_code$ node dist/main_nft.js

      -------------------
      [Aptos SDK] It is recommended that private keys are AIP-80 compliant (https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-80.md). You can fix the private key by formatting it with `PrivateKey.formatPrivateKey(privateKey: string, type: 'ed25519' | 'secp256k1'): string`.
